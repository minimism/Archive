# Wonkystuff

This repo will contain a few sound-generating/processing schematics/code for Wonkystuff hardware :)

## dr.1

*dr.1* is an ATTiny85-based noise-maker partly arising from the question *'So what can you do with an 8-pin microcontroller?'*. At the moment it's a work-in-progress, very much documenting the preliminary exploratory steps when dealing with new hardware!
