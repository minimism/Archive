# Wonkystuff

This repo will contain a few sound-generating/processing schematics/code for Wonkystuff hardware :)

## basic

*basic* is an ATTiny85-based tone generator, put together just to get acquainted with the basic techniqies
of getting an 8MHz, 8-pin microcontroller to make noises. As it stands, it's a two-oscillator tone generator
which supports audio-rate FM/PM of each oscillator, so it could be useful as a building block for something.
